First of all, i did not expect such a Pathetic app from ""Google"". and afcourse if you thought service from google would be class apart--> believe me its all fake.
Nobody addressess your concerns. Like the rest of the buisnessess Tez support also plays blame game with you. not to forget, their technical representative will
try to charm by the standard line "" sorry for the incoonvinience caused"". I am avid user of banking apps. let me tell you home banking apps are the best.
By the way TEZ does not know where the money lays if transaction fails(afcourse transaction failure is very common). When you call TEZ tech support they will 
redirect you to your refistered bank and provide you the contact number of the bank too. let also put some light on this, When i tried connecting to the  provided contact number of bank,
turns out the number do not exist. Seriously, can you guys not confirm before providing the correct information. By the way ill specify my registered bank with the app is HDFC.
Is it so difficult to provide correct number?
I made a transaction on 8th November and i still do not have the clarity to know where the money is, leave about getting it back.

As per the APP it says ""MONEY DEPOSITED IN RECIPIENTS BANK"". where di you pull this information from. Why is you contomer service representative not ready to confirm on the same.

Ultimately DISAPPOINTED WITH tez AND google",1,FALSE,Pathetic app,rottenblade397,

    Read In full:

I tend to use lots of payments app and always remain open minded when using them. Be it PhonePe, BHim, Chillr etc.. 
However Tez looks to have the most Un QC‚Äôd app of all of them. Now if this was a game or simple app which helps you in managing your phone then it would have been a different thing, but it‚Äôs our money Tez is playing with. 
I had a failure of ‚Çπ500+ once, talked with their customer support and I was assured the matter will be taken care off.
I had a 3 Times failure of money transfer since then. Now here is the real frustrating thing.. the ‚Äúproblem reporting‚Äù to Tez option of a ‚Äúfailed transfer‚Äù opens after 3 days. The money gets deducted immediately and I am waiting to get back my money for over a week. As per Tez this can take up to 60 days.
Update: 17 days down the line, I have not received and I do have 2 other friends whose money got stuck as well, BEWARE if you can.

This is a feedback for you to look into this issue now, one of transactions is failed and the amount been debited from my bank account but it‚Äôs not been refunded automatically. When I contacted the GP Team for this, I was told it will be credited to the beneficiary within 3 business days and I will have to contact them to get that back. This is a ridiculous process and there is no ownership that GP holds with any transaction other than simply debited money. I had same scenario couple of times and o had to contact the receiver to give the money back(like seriously!!!!). I am now in an ever more plight this time, I should be contacting a government organisation (IRCTC) to get my money back, I absolutely have no hope for this and it‚Äôs frustrating.

I use IOS 12.3.1 and I cannot add my Standard charted bank account to my google pay. It says my mobile is linked to multiple accounts or I don‚Äôt have this no linked with Bank.

Yes I have linked this no with other banks so what ?
And off course I have account with SC bank and this no is linked to it. So  I don‚Äôt understand the error at all.

Already I have send the error log to google pay support team from the app twice, but no response until now.

22-03-2020 20:31,"This is the review after using google pay for over of 2 years. Here is the list why  u should avoid google pay for UPI transactions:
1. If u are looking just for rewards  dont use google pay , u wont get any rewards. It is super rare getting rewards in tez.
2. Frequent transaction failures. Or transaction issues. Some are : money is debited but not sent. , showing money is sent but deposited in receiver account.
3. Very slow customer service. Besides this frequent transactions issues if u contact google pay customer care chat , all they do is have u wait for 15-25 min and when u connect , they take another 15 min to find ur problem and at last they say to wait until money is deposited (actually customer care does nothing).

You guys have done excellent work. Now, google pay works absolutely fine in my iPhone XR, but I think there‚Äôs still a bug inside the app. 

When I start registration with UPI, an SMS is sent to activate UPI. If you have an eSim and a physical sim both at the same time inside your device then a pop up window will appear asking to send SMS manually. Once you‚Äôll send SMS manually from that pop up windows and come back to the app, you‚Äôll find the registration process already failed with a message saying that you should not leave the app during setup.

Now it‚Äôs not me who is leaving the app intentionally, it is the system which is asking me to send SMS manually because I have two SIM (eSim and Physical) cards inside my device.

Even with this bug, I successfully registered the UPI. You just have to press send button instantly when that SMS pop up window appear and google pay will not give any error.

This app has a glitch. It can give you nightmare if you are trying to reactivate your bank account or if you are trying to retrieve your old or existing UPI ID. It offers use of multiple UPI IDs for better transactions but switching between them is impossible at times. After 3 failed attempts at reactivation of bank account or UPI ID, the app does not let you try again for next 24 hours, if you fail again after 24 hours (which is likely because of this glitchy app), you will again have to wait for another 24 hours. And the cycle sadly repeats. I‚Äôve been trying since last two days to meet a deadline for an auto-pay mandate but looks like I will not be able to complete it in thine because of this glitch. I thought calling customer care might be useful but the 2-minute wait followed by a 10-15 minutes of discussion didn‚Äôt yield any solution instead made me feel that Google doesn‚Äôt really care to offer any quick solution nor fix the issues with the app. After talking to customer care support, I felt that I should stop using this app. I will switch to PhonePe and also hope that Apple soon launches the Apple Pay service in India on full scale so that we have a reliable solution and a good alternative to this glitchy app.",1,FALSE,Terrible customer support & glitchy app,Dr Ganapati Hegde,

I'm writing to provide feedback regarding the recent update to the Google Pay app. Unfortunately, since the update, I've been experiencing frequent freezes within the application. These freezes occur intermittently and make the app nearly unusable.
As a regular user of Google Pay, this issue has significantly impacted my experience with the app.
It's frustrating to encounter these freezes, especially when attempting to make transactions or access essential features.
I kindly request that your team investigate this matter promptly to identify and resolve the root cause of the freezing issue. Ensuring the stability and functionality of the app is crucial for providing a seamless experience to users like myself.
