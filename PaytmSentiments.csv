22-11-2017 17:11,"Paytm has been a trusted payments app all these years. Having developed to this day with add-on’s like Paytm Mall and Bank, Paytm surely has built a base to notch the finance market among all its competitors. Coming to the promotions, Paytm shows more interest in its new customers so as to attract them, just hoped it was a bit more loyal to its tenured ones. Other than the promo codes which is allowed once per user, or to the codes for new users, Paytm has to show some interest and invest on its promo codes for the customers who have been with the company since the very beginning.

11-11-2017 15:06,"Although the app does what it’s supposed to do, it just isn’t a well optimised app.

Some places that need attention are:
1) Speed.
Transitions between different sections of the app is quite slow and jittery.

2) Interface.
The interface is just not intuitive enough. Maybe some reorganisation of sections and some hierarchy in menus would be nice.

3) Aesthetics.
Although the recent version are much better than what Paytm looked like before, it still doesn’t look quite as well as other apps. It would be nice if you could give an overhaul to how the interface looks and make it cleaner. Especially the payment processing/completion page. You can make it look much cleaner by clearing up the unnecessary text and putting an emphasis on the “Success” or “Processing” status (because that’s what we really care about in that page!).

Otherwise, it’s a good app and does the work pretty well. :)",5,FALSE,Works good - feels bad,iamAnkitRoy

28-12-2017 06:06,"Hi Team,

The recently launched new UI is far from exceptional and a lot of things can be done to make it more intuitive and efficient.

On the make payment screen:
- it took me a while a find the place where I can enter the amount 
- type your message is so small that it didn’t even catch my attention 

These 2 are the most important CTAs on this page and these are so subtle in the new design that I believe most of the users will not be able to use this. It’s only when I clicked “proceed to pay”, then I realised that I’ve not filled the amount itself.

Previous design with lots of white space was way better.
In case you want to stay with this design, please enable a blinking cursor on the amount placeholder and make the number keyboard open by default.

Keep innovating but do keep users in mind too.",5,FALSE,New UI Not Good,Akash Deep Goldy

user-experience. I use paytm app to make a metro and phone recharge, it’s very
easy and instant. Very nice guys, good app.  It happened once, I lost my
password and I was not able to login into my account. I immediately reached out
to their customer care and they immediately processed my request and thanks to
their prompt response I was able to reset my password. Customer care of Paytm
is really fast and I have full faith in the app. The app is pretty much
dependable and I don’t even think twice adding huge sums of amount to my Paytm
wallet from my bank.  Earlier I was using some other app for recharge and
I faced many problems like unsuccessful transactions, frequent hangs, poor
customer care services. But with Paytm app, the transactions take very less
time and app is very much reliable & secure. I mostly use Paytm app for my
cabs. Its such a relief, I don’t need to pay cash or even worry whether I have

Though my friend told me once that paytm charges a fee to transfer money from paytm wallet to paytm bank. But the thing is that i was never charged with this before. I have been using paytm since 8-9 months but since a week ago paytm started charging money for me to transfer my own money from wallet to bank. I even bought a paytm debit card so that i can make my expense directly from paytm bank. Now, They are charging 200₹ for some amount of my pocket money to get it transferred to my paytm bank. Well I don’t see any reason to give this much amount to paytm just for the sake of transferring your own money from their (paytm) wallet to their (paytm) account only. 

And when i tried contacting paytm , it’s always unresponsive. It’s better to stick out apps for like google pay or bheem upi apps rather than this.

Paytm has finally automated their customer service which is now run by ROBOTS 🤖 rather than HUMANS. 
Now, everything runs in auto-pilot [read as auto-reply].
Lately, I have been unable to login to paytm app (Note that I’m able to login paytm’s other applications and through website using same credentials).
First I raised a query via mail. Got an auto-reply saying that please get in touch via customer care service. 
Then I called them and they asked to mail them all the details on the same mail ID on which I had mailed already. 
I mailed them again with all the details (screen-shots, and all details about the scenario and even how to reproduce the issue). 
And then, It started again - getting auto-replies - please send us screen-shots, reset your password, blah blah blah. I have replied them 6 times so far but to add to the frustration, their customer service is still running on auto-pilot. 

Sincere Advice - If you ever need to deal with their customer care service [omit ‘care’, because 🤖s don’t care] - Just UNINSTALL the app. There is just no use banging your head in the wall. 🤯

It’s a good app.. but what’s happening with KYC..it says KYC expired..now what does it mean? You used to know ur customers.. and now you forgot..see guys, once KYC done, it’s done.. you can set up a limit on transactions/amount based on KYC type.. but you can’t ask them to visit ur centre to complete full KYC and then only someone can use the app..

now coming back to ur application UI.. as you placed a button Complete KYC.. that should redirect to some meaningful pages.. could be nearby permanent centres.. types of KYC.. e-verification.. but now it’s saying something went wrong... yes.. something went wrong with your marketing strategy.. 

Please fix this.. or we’ll start finding an alternate..

It initially starts with a 5 minute countdown that agonisingly trickles down to 20 seconds and then refreshes back to 29 seconds endlessly.

21-09-2023 12:56,"Title: Extremely Dissatisfied with Paytm's Service I must express my extreme dissatisfaction with Paytm's services. My recent encounters with this platform have left me thoroughly disappointed. First and foremost, Paytm's customer service is abysmal. Trying to get assistance for any issue feels like an uphill battle. Response times are excruciatingly slow, and when you do manage to get in touch with a representative, the quality of support provided leaves much to be desired. It's a far cry from the responsive and helpful customer service one would expect from a reputable company. Moreover, Paytm often suffers from technical glitches and service outages. These disruptions have caused significant inconveniences during important transactions. It's baffling that a platform of this scale doesn't seem to invest adequately in ensuring a stable and reliable service. Security concerns also loom large. Reports of data breaches and privacy lapses have left me questioning the safety of my personal and financial information stored on the app. All in all, my experience with Paytm has been marked by frustration and disappointment. In a market where numerous digital payment options are available, it's clear that Paytm has a long way to go in terms of improving its service quality and addressing customer concerns.

 I tried closing my Fastag account. That took 7 days, instead of 3, which their FAQ says. I tried closing the entire PayTM account. They are not even allowing that now. The page is consistently throwing errors. It’s like they are forcefully not allowing their users to leave the platform.

Even after using their services for so long, i don’t receive any perks, i keep hoping.
Just recently i was made paytm pro user, but what the benefit? It’s useless to me, the cashback points applies on all services that I don’t use
This is laughable and so so disappointing!
Recently booked flight tickets and saw convenience fee of 600/- rupees! I mean why are you guys charging so much with no real benefits? I would rather book from the airline website, they charge lesser convenience fee.
And the cashback vouchers are completely useless, such a cheating platform
