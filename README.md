The research considers the sentiments of the users and performs sentiment analysis to understand their 
response to the evolution of cashless payment, through Google Pay, Phone Pe, and Paytm UPI apps.. The data for 
the same was collected by web scraping app reviews, and were then categorised as positive, negative and neutral, 
in the periods namely categorised as Pre-Covid, Post-Covid, and during Covid periods. Later, the study used 
machine learning and deep learning models, viz: LSTM (long short-term memory), ARIMA and SARIMA, to 
predict future transaction volumes of these apps based on empirical UPI data from the NPCI website. 
The study pre-processed transaction volume data from 2017 to 2024 and forecasted usage from 2025 onwards to 
understand the trajectory of cashless payments in India. The models were considerably successful in predicting 
the transaction volumes for Google Pay, Phone Pe, and Paytm, identifying which app is will most likely be used 
in the future. The study provides valuable insights for industry practitioners and academic researchers into the 
evolution of cashless payment apps in India, wherein the models can help in providing better insights for better 
financial forecasting. 
The findings can have a significant impact on fintech companies, for using data-driven strategies and for 
optimal operational efficiencies that support the global adoption and evolution of secure cashless payment 
systems. The effectiveness and advantages of LSTM, ARIMA, and SARIMA models is also highlighted in our 
research which will thereby help in forecasting UPI transaction over time, contributing to the field of financial 
time series analysis.
