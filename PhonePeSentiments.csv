16-11-2018 22:13,"Dear Team,
I usually do not write reviews for Apps, either I like them and keep them or I don‚Äôt like them and delete them, however as much as I like this app PhonePe, I have to point out that there is a huge flaw in the app, if I want to pay the electricity bill for my home, dth bill, several mobile no. in my house, gas connection, house tax etc. Its really non sensical and absolutely illogical that I keep entering the account no. everytime I want to pay for the same account. for eg. my house is going to have same meter or connection no. and i don‚Äôt want to remember the connection no. so the app must ask me and save this info under respective category.. so that next time when i come to the app and want to pay my electricity bill i dont have to fish for the bill and feed the elections account no. again and again.. everytime.. the app is good, but this is something really important if the app developers are really looking for making it a convenience to use the app and not a hassle.. 

also if all ppl are not comfortable with the app saving those details you can also ask them while making the payment if they‚Äôd like to save it or not if they choose yes the app will store this info for them..

i will rate it 3 stars for now, but if i get this feature, i will rate it 5.. mo response to the review will -1 star every week..

thanks n regards,

They have the worst customer service. In past two months I contacted them for 3 different issues. Considering that I trusted them with my money the least I expected was the customer support guys to hear me out. But instead of resolving the issue they yelled at me! I was shocked at the first instance when the phone support associate raised her voice on me. But then it happened all the times I received called from them. They were utterly rude, disrespectful and always shouted. It was pretty clear that they don‚Äôt care about a good customer experience. Also the responses they give for all the tickets raised are just generic canned replies and doesn‚Äôt address the issue at all.

You cannot reason with them because they will never listen to you or read what you write. Its funny actually how are they running their business like this.

The worst part is that you can't even open the wallet again as they don't have any way to resolve this issue. Every time I raise a ticket for the same, I get the response that currently I cannot open it... I fail to understand how long they will take to resolve this issue? 

Guys, you should have a customer care number or something that can address people's complaints instead of having a computer bot answering the same thing again and again. It is just very annoying.

Show bank account balances on the same page like how PayTM does it rather than showing it on a separate temporary page. Sometimes it is required to view all balances in one page.

I reached out to them regarding an issue in Mutual fund redeem I was facing with a transaction, expecting prompt and helpful assistance. However, the support team's response was shockingly irresponsible and unhelpful.

Despite explaining my issue in detail, the support team seemed disinterested and provided generic, scripted responses that did not address my concerns. It was evident that they lacked the willingness to understand and resolve my problem effectively. Furthermore, the response time was excessively long, leaving me hanging for days without a satisfactory resolution, not yet resolved.

As a customer, I value efficient and reliable support, especially when dealing with financial transactions. Unfortunately, PhonePe fell short in this aspect, failing to provide the level of service one would expect from a leading digital payment platform.

I sincerely hope that PhonePe takes customer feedback seriously and implements measures to improve their support services. Until then, I'll have to reconsider my trust in their platform and explore alternatives that prioritize customer satisfaction.
